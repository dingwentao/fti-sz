1) Make sure that lossy checkpointing library is accessible in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2) Go to "lossy-checkpoint/build/examples".

3) With your favorite text editor open and edit the checkpointing configuration file
   config.fti to set the three directory variables.
    - vim config.fti (Edit Ckpt_dir, Glbl_dir, Meta_dir)

4) Edit the lossy compression configuration file sz.config to set the parameters for
	lossy compression, such as error bound mode and error bound.
	- vim sz.config

5) Run example by going to lossy-checkpoint/build/examples and:
	- execute:	"make hd"	<- runs first example (heatdis.c) with no compressor
	- after FTI creates checkpoint press "ctrl + c" to abort a process
	- execute:	"make hd"
	- see that work will continue from last checkpoint
	- wait for program to finish

6) Change to SZ lossy compressor and re-run example:
	- vim config.fit: compressor = 3
	- execute:	"make hd"	<- runs first example (heatdis.c) with no compressor
	- after FTI creates checkpoint press "ctrl + c" to abort a process
	- execute:	"make hd"
	- see that work will continue from last checkpoint
	- wait for program to finish
